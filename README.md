## Setup

**1. Clone the application**

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/milans-store.git`

---

**2. Create MySQL database (if not using Docker)**

`CREATE DATABASE milan_store;`

> _Skip this step if you're running the app via Docker. The database will be auto-created._

**Change MySQL username and password as per your credentials**

+ Open the `application.yml` file located at `src/main/resources/application.yml`.

+ Update the `spring.datasource.username` and `password` properties with your MySQL credentials.

---

**3. Create `.env` file**

In the project root directory, create a `.env` file and add your email credentials:

`EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password`

> _This is used for email notifications (e.g. order confirmations and its status, verify account when register, reset password)._

---

**4. Run the app using Docker (recommended)**

`docker-compose up --build`

- App will be accessible at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

- Swagger Api Docs: [http://localhost:8080/milan-docs](http://localhost:8080/milan-docs)

To stop the containers:

`docker-compose down`

**5. Run the app using Maven (alternative)**

If you prefer to run locally without Docker:

- Update `application.yml` (host: `localhost`, port: `3306`)

- Then run:

`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

---
